                The Primary Button is your go-to choice for emphasizing the most
                important actions within your application. It stands out,
                commands attention, and invites users to take action. It is
                designed to be visually distinct, making it the focal point of
                action on the screen. With a clear and compelling design, the
                Primary Button ensures that users can easily identify and engage
                with your key features.
