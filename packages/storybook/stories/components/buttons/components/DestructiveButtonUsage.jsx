        Incorporate a destructive button when an action has irreversible or
        high-impact consequences, requiring users to confirm their intention
        before proceeding. Consider the gravity of the operation and its
        potential effects on the user&apos;s data or the system. Ensure that the
        presence of a destructive button aligns with the importance and
        potential risks associated with the corresponding action.
